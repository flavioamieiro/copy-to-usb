=How to use Copy to usb=

To use this script all you have to do is put it in .gnome2/nautilus-scripts/ (located inside your home folder) and give it permission to be executed using the following command:
{{{
chmod +x _filename_
}}}

where _filename_ is the name of the script (you may rename it as you will, but the default name is `copy_to_usb-`_version_).

After following these steps, a "script" menu should appear in the context menu when you right-click on any file. Navigating inside it you should find Copy to usb. Now you just need to click it.
